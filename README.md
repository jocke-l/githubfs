githubfs
========

Inspired by [github1s](https://github.com/conwnet/github1s) `githubfs` is a
FUSE driver that mounts a remote github repository as read-only.  This makes it
possible to view files almost instantly in your favorite editor.

This is mostly a personal exercise for me to get to know golang better.
